## Project Overview
In the early years of the 21st century, the health landscape has been significantly influenced by the rise of new viruses and global outbreaks. Roughly ten years apart, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced two major pandemics: influenza A H1N1 in 2009 and COVID-19 in 2020. Additionally, the world has seen outbreaks of non-respiratory viruses such as Zika, Chikungunya, and Ebola, which have garnered significant attention from global health authorities. Given these occurrences, it's evident that viruses will increasingly shape the realm of infectious diseases in the coming decades.
The year 2020 was unexpectedly dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which first appeared in Wuhan, China, towards the end of 2019. This pandemic is attributed to a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, known to cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), hence its classification within the SARS taxonomy. Notably, there had been prior alerts about coronaviruses being potential pandemic triggers. This was evidenced by the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002-2003 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012 .

To sum up, the two prominent pandemics of this century were caused by distinct viruses, yet shared similarities, such as being enveloped RNA viruses with typically spherical shapes. Another noteworthy observation is the frequent mutations of these viruses and the wide range of hosts they can infect. Recognizing the significance of understanding the epidemiology of these pandemics, this research aims to understand how peopleâ€™s backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors are related to their personal vaccination patterns can provide guidance for future public health efforts especially when handling pandemics such as
